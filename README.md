Tools for profinet configuration

# Requirements
This software is based on the famouse *WinPcap* libraris

I suggest to use the [npcap](https://nmap.org/npcap/) improvement for better performace

Plese download it from [here](https://nmap.org/npcap/dist/npcap-0.98.exe) and install it.

During the installation choose the option **WinPcap compatibility**

# Usage

ProfinetTools is an improvement of the opensource project [profinetexplorer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/profinetexplorer/) writte with modern WPF and reactive programming.

It has a very simple user interface that allows you to scan your profinet network and assign names or ip configurations.
